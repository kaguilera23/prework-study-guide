# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

With the bootcamp allowing for multiple topics to be mastered in such a short period of time, there's a lot of information learned daily. It's nice to have a place for all the notes taken during the couse, and an easy guide on where to start to get the most out of your time. This webpages takes the multiple pages of scribbled notes a student has and allows them to put them into a neatly-typed location for easy viewing and studying. This takes the problem of flipping through pages in your notes and turns it into an easy-to-read screenpage. With it being online, you don't have to lug around a notebook and worry about pages getting ripped, getting wet, etc. I learned the basics to a lot of web applications is HTML, which is the building blocks of a webpage, CSS, which is the styling componenet, and JavaScript, or any other programming language to help with user interactivity on a webpage. I also learned there are ways to allow multiple people to work on a project at once without interfering with another's work and stay up-to-date on the latest code changes.
